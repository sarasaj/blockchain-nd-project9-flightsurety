i'm submitting this project in hopes it'll pass .. i'm very depressed i spent a month in a loop of non-stop non logical errors .. some errors i asked my mentors to debug with me and they couldn't figure out the bug although the logic is correct .. so i hope you might have an idea 
i did everything as the rubric state
